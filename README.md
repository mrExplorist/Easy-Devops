## Introduction to DevOps

DevOps is a cultural and technical movement that aims to enhance collaboration between software development and IT operations teams. It emphasizes automation, continuous feedback, and continuous delivery to achieve faster and more reliable software development and deployment.

## Docker: Containerization Platform

Docker is a leading containerization platform that allows developers to package applications and their dependencies into portable containers. It enables consistent and reliable software delivery across different environments.

Learn more about Docker in the dedicated [Docker README](/Docker).

## Kubernetes: Container Orchestration Platform

Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It provides a powerful and flexible environment for running, coordinating, and scaling applications in a distributed system.

Learn more about Kubernetes in the dedicated [Kubernetes README](/Kubernetes/kubernetes.md).

## Continuous Integration (CI)

Continuous Integration is a software development practice that involves merging code changes into a shared repository frequently. Automated tests and builds are triggered to ensure that new code integrates smoothly with the existing codebase.

## Continuous Deployment (CD)

Continuous Deployment extends Continuous Integration by automatically deploying code changes to production after successful testing. This approach accelerates the delivery of new features and bug fixes to end-users.

## Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) treats infrastructure configuration as version-controlled code. It enables developers to define and manage infrastructure using code, leading to improved consistency and reproducibility.

## Containerization

Containerization, exemplified by tools like Docker, allows developers to package applications and their dependencies into isolated containers. Containers provide consistent and isolated runtime environments for applications.

## Monitoring and Logging

Monitoring and logging are crucial DevOps practices for observing system performance, identifying issues, and gathering insights for continuous improvement.

## Collaboration and Communication

DevOps emphasizes effective collaboration and communication among team members to foster a culture of shared responsibility and trust.
