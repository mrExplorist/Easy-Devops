## What is Kubernetes?

Kubernetes is a powerful and flexible platform that enables users to manage containerized applications across a cluster of nodes. At its core, Kubernetes aims to solve the challenges that arise when managing a large number of containers distributed across multiple hosts.

Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It was originally developed by Google and is now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). Kubernetes provides a flexible and extensible architecture, making it suitable for a wide range of applications and infrastructure setups.

The fundamental purpose of Kubernetes is to:

1. **Orchestrate Containers**: Kubernetes allows you to run, manage, and interact with containers effectively. It abstracts away the complexity of dealing with individual containers and provides a higher-level API for managing them as cohesive units.

2. **Scale Applications**: Kubernetes can automatically scale the number of container replicas based on user-defined rules and metrics. This capability ensures that applications can handle varying levels of traffic without manual intervention.

3. **Self-Heal Applications**: Kubernetes monitors the health of applications and, if a container or node fails, it automatically restarts or reschedules the affected containers to maintain application availability.

4. **Provide Network and Service Abstractions**: Kubernetes offers advanced networking capabilities, enabling seamless communication between containers and services. Services provide stable endpoints for applications to interact with one another.

5. **Declare Desired State**: Kubernetes operates on a declarative model, allowing users to specify the desired state of their applications and infrastructure through configuration files. The control plane works to achieve and maintain this desired state.

# Kubernetes: What it Solves that Docker Can't

Now shedding light on the unique capabilities that Kubernetes brings to the table, beyond what Docker offers. While Docker is an excellent tool for containerization, Kubernetes takes container management to the next level with its container orchestration capabilities.

## Introduction

While Docker simplifies the process of creating, packaging, and running containers on a single host, Kubernetes takes containerization to a higher level by managing containerized applications across a cluster of nodes. Let's explore the unique problems that Kubernetes solves, which Docker alone cannot address.

| Platform       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Docker**     | Docker is a leading containerization platform that allows developers to package applications and their dependencies into a single container. It ensures consistency across different environments, making applications highly portable. Docker offers an easy-to-use interface and is an essential tool in modern application development and deployment workflows. |
| **Kubernetes** | Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform that builds upon Docker's containerization capabilities. It automates the deployment, scaling, and operation of containerized applications in a distributed environment.                                                                                                                              |

## Here's how Kubernetes extends beyond what Docker can do:

### Scalability and Load Balancing

Kubernetes excels in scaling applications across multiple nodes in a cluster. With its Deployment and ReplicaSet objects, Kubernetes ensures that the desired number of replicas (Pods) are always running, even during heavy traffic or when nodes fail. It distributes incoming network traffic efficiently with built-in load balancing for services, ensuring high availability and optimal resource utilization.

Imagine your website has thousands of different clients per minute. It is not easy for a single server to keep up with the requests demand. This creates a bad user experience with unpredictable downtimes.
In Kubernetes, a LoadBalancer Service is a crucial component for deploying and managing applications in Kubernetes. It exposes a service externally in the underlying infrastructure (for example, a cloud provider's load balancer).

<img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/6icyfeiq/production/b0d01c6c9496b910ab29d2746f9ab109d10fb3cf-1320x588.png?w=952&h=424&q=75&fit=max&auto=format&dpr=2" alt="k8s loadbalancing" width="600px">

The LoadBalancer Service provides load-balancing abilities for incoming traffic to distribute evenly across multiple pods for better performance and high availability. It also allows you to scale up or down your application based on demand without affecting other services running on the same cluster. This is achieved by using a combination of Kubernetes' built-in features such as Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA), ReplicaSets, and Deployments. These features allow you to scale your application horizontally by adding more pods when needed and vertically by increasing the number of resources allocated to each pod. This ensures that your application can handle high traffic volumes without any downtime or performance issues.

### Self-Healing and High Availability

Unlike Docker, Kubernetes offers self-healing capabilities. If a Pod or container fails due to hardware issues or other reasons, Kubernetes automatically detects the failure and reschedules or recreates the Pod on a healthy node, ensuring that the application remains available. Kubernetes continuously monitors the health of applications and automatically restarts or replaces containers that fail. It can also take actions based on defined health checks.

### Declarative Configuration and Desired State

Kubernetes operates on a declarative model. Users define the desired state of their applications and infrastructure using YAML or JSON files. The Kubernetes control plane continuously monitors the actual state of the cluster and takes corrective actions to bring it closer to the desired state, ensuring consistency and ease of management.This makes it easier to manage and automate complex deployments.

### Networking and Service Discovery

Kubernetes provides advanced networking capabilities, enabling seamless communication between containers and services. With built-in service discovery, applications can easily find and connect to other services without worrying about the underlying network setup.

### Advanced Deployments and Rollbacks

Kubernetes allows for sophisticated deployment strategies, such as rolling updates and canary deployments. These strategies minimize downtime during application updates and enable easy rollbacks in case of issues.

### Horizontal Pod Autoscaling

Kubernetes automatically adjusts the number of running replicas (Pods) based on resource utilization or custom metrics through Horizontal Pod Autoscaling. This dynamic scaling ensures efficient resource utilization and cost savings.

`Kubernetes can efficiently scale applications based on demand, handling large workloads effectively and maintaining performance.
`

`While Docker is excellent for local development and packaging applications into containers, Kubernetes provides a powerful and comprehensive solution for managing containerized applications at scale. Kubernetes' container orchestration capabilities, including scalability, self-healing, declarative configuration, advanced deployments, and more, make it a must-have tool for production-grade, distributed environments.`

# Kubernetes Components and Architecture

### Kubernetes architecture is divided into two main parts: the `Control Plane` and the `Data Plane`

## Control Plane

The Control Plane serves as the "brains" of the Kubernetes cluster. It acts as the central control and management hub, making high-level decisions about the desired state of the system and working to bring the actual state in line with it. Essentially, the Control Plane is responsible for managing the Kubernetes cluster and its components.
The control plane is a logical entity made up of various components running on the master node. It manages the overall state and orchestration of the cluster. It is responsible for making decisions about the desired state of the system and taking actions to achieve it. The control plane continuously monitors the cluster's actual state and takes corrective actions to reconcile any differences between the actual and desired states. It also handles the scheduling and placement of workloads on the cluster.

### Responsibilities

The Control Plane is responsible for the following tasks:

- **Reconciliation**: Continuously monitoring the cluster's desired state and taking action to ensure the actual state matches it.
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Handling the scaling of application replicas based on the desired state and resource availability.
- **Self-Healing**: Detecting and responding to node or pod failures by restarting or rescheduling affected components.
- **Authorization and Authentication**: Enforcing security policies by authenticating and authorizing users and applications.
- **Configuration and Secrets Management**: Managing configuration data and secrets for applications running on the cluster.
- **Scheduling**: Assigning workloads to nodes based on resource availability and constraints.
- **Networking and Service Discovery**: Managing network rules and providing service discovery and load balancing among containers and services.
- **API Endpoint**: Exposing the Kubernetes API, which serves as the primary interface for interacting with the cluster.
- **Cluster Management**: Managing the cluster's configuration data and the desired state of the resources.
- **Resource Monitoring**: Reporting resource usage and health status to the Control Plane for better decision-making.
- **Logging and Monitoring**: Collecting and aggregating logs and metrics from cluster components and applications.
- **Cluster Upgrades**: Performing rolling upgrades of the cluster to ensure that all components are running the latest versions.
- **Cluster Add-ons**: Managing add-ons such as the Kubernetes Dashboard, DNS, and container networking.
- **Cloud Integration**: Integrating with the cloud provider's APIs to manage resources such as load balancers, storage volumes, and instances.
- **Cluster Federation**: Managing multiple Kubernetes clusters as a single entity.
- **Cluster Autoscaling**: Automatically scaling the cluster based on resource utilization and demand.
- **Cluster Backup and Restore**: Backing up and restoring the cluster's configuration data and state.
- **Cluster Security**: Enforcing security policies and best practices to protect the cluster from malicious attacks.
- **Cluster Maintenance**: Performing routine maintenance tasks such as node upgrades and security patches.
- **Cluster Troubleshooting**: Troubleshooting issues with the cluster and its components.
- **Cluster Monitoring**: Monitoring the health and performance of the cluster and its components.
- **Cluster Logging**: Collecting and aggregating logs from cluster components and applications.
- **Cluster Auditing**: Auditing the cluster's configuration and state to ensure compliance with security policies and best practices.
- **Cluster Networking**: Managing network rules and providing service discovery and load balancing among containers and services.
- **Cluster Storage**: Managing storage volumes and providing persistent storage for applications running on the cluster.

### Components

![Kube-component](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51878265/197317939-d7e8ecbb-912c-4223-b64a-1c46cbac255f.png)
Image Source: [Kubernetes Components](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/components/)

The main components of the Kubernetes Control Plane are:

1. **kube-apiserver**: This component exposes the Kubernetes API, which serves as the primary interface for interacting with the cluster. Clients, such as `kubectl` or the Kubernetes Dashboard, communicate with the kube-apiserver to create, update, and delete resources in the cluster.

2. **etcd**: It is a distributed key-value store that acts as the cluster's database. The kube-apiserver uses etcd to store the cluster's configuration data and the desired state of the resources.

3. **kube-scheduler**: The kube-scheduler is responsible for making decisions about where to place newly created pods based on factors like resource availability, node constraints, and quality of service requirements.

4. **kube-controller-manager**: This component includes several individual controllers responsible for managing different aspects of the cluster, such as node controller, replication controller, endpoint controller, and service account controller.

5. **cloud-controller-manager** (optional): In cloud-based Kubernetes clusters, this component integrates with the cloud provider's APIs to manage resources such as load balancers, storage volumes, and instances.

## Data Plane

The Data Plane, also known as the User Plane or the Worker Plane, is responsible for executing the actual workload and handling user traffic. It consists of the worker nodes in the Kubernetes cluster, where containers are scheduled and executed.

### Components

The main components of the Kubernetes Data Plane are:

1. **kubelet**: The kubelet is an agent that runs on each worker node and is responsible for interacting with the Control Plane. It receives Pod specifications from the Control Plane and ensures the requested containers are running and healthy on the node.

2. **kube-proxy**: The kube-proxy runs on each worker node and is responsible for network communication within the cluster. It maintains network rules and load balancing for services to ensure seamless communication between pods and external traffic.

### Responsibilities

The Data Plane is responsible for the following tasks:

- **Container Management**: Running and managing containers based on Pod specifications provided by the Control Plane.

- **Networking**: Managing network rules and providing service discovery and load balancing among containers and services.

- **Resource Monitoring**: Reporting resource usage and health status to the Control Plane for better decision-making.

### Nodes

**In Kubernetes, a node is a fundamental building block of the cluster. It represents a single machine (physical or virtual) that is part of the larger Kubernetes cluster. Each node is responsible for running containerized applications and executing the workloads assigned to it by the control plane. Understanding nodes is essential for comprehending how Kubernetes distributes and manages containers in a cluster.**

### 1. **Master Nodes:**

- Master nodes are the control plane components of the Kubernetes cluster. They manage the overall state of the cluster, make decisions about the desired state of the system, and coordinate the activities of worker nodes.
- The master nodes are responsible for handling the API requests, monitoring the cluster, and maintaining the desired configuration. They ensure that the system operates as expected and reacts to changes in the cluster's state.
- The core components running on master nodes are:

  - **kube-apiserver**: The API server acts as the front-end for the Kubernetes control plane. It exposes the Kubernetes API and processes RESTful API requests from users and other components. It validates and updates the state of the cluster accordingly.
  - **kube-controller-manager**: The controller manager runs multiple controllers that continuously monitor the state of different objects in the cluster (e.g., pods, services, nodes). When there are deviations from the desired state, the controllers take corrective actions to bring the system back to the desired state.
  - **kube-scheduler**: The scheduler is responsible for assigning newly created pods to nodes within the cluster. It takes into account factors like resource availability, affinity/anti-affinity rules, and node constraints when making scheduling decisions.
  - **etcd**: While not strictly a component of the control plane, etcd is a distributed key-value store used as the persistent data store for Kubernetes. It stores the cluster's configuration data and the current state of all objects in the cluster.

- Typically, there are multiple master nodes in a Kubernetes cluster, with one of them acting as the "leader" and the others as "followers." The leader node is responsible for handling write operations to the cluster, while the follower nodes replicate the data from the leader for high availability.

### 2. **Worker Nodes:**

- Worker nodes, also known as minion nodes, are the worker machines in the Kubernetes cluster. They host the actual containers and handle the execution of application workloads.
- Worker nodes run the kubelet, which is responsible for managing the containers on the node as per the pod specifications received from the master nodes. The kubelet interacts with the container runtime (e.g., Docker, containerd) to start, stop, and monitor containers.
- The core components running on worker nodes are:

  - **kubelet**: Kubelet is an agent running on each worker node. It communicates with the Kubernetes API server on the master nodes and ensures that containers defined in pod specifications are running and healthy on the node.
  - **Container Runtime**: The container runtime, such as Docker or containerd, is responsible for pulling container images from registries and running them as containers on the node.
  - **kube-proxy**: Kube-proxy is responsible for network proxying and load balancing. It maintains network rules to ensure that packets are correctly forwarded to the appropriate destination pods.

- Worker nodes perform the actual workload processing and host multiple pods. The number of worker nodes in the cluster can vary depending on the application requirements and the desired level of fault tolerance and scalability.

**Communication between Master and Worker Nodes:**

- The master nodes communicate with the worker nodes to manage the state of the cluster and orchestrate the deployment and execution of applications.
- The kubelet running on each worker node communicates with the kube-apiserver on the master nodes to receive pod specifications and report the status of the node and its pods.

In summary, master nodes in Kubernetes are responsible for managing the cluster's control plane, while worker nodes handle the execution of application workloads by running containers and managing the pod lifecycle. Together, they form the foundation of a Kubernetes cluster, providing container orchestration, scalability, and fault-tolerance.

### 3. **Pods:**

The smallest and simplest unit in Kubernetes is the Pod. A Pod can contain one or more tightly coupled containers that share the same network namespace and can communicate with each other locally via `localhost`.
In Kubernetes, a Pod is the smallest and simplest unit that you can deploy. It represents a single instance of a running process in a cluster. A Pod can contain one or more tightly coupled containers that share the same network namespace, storage volumes, and other resources.

Pods are the basic building blocks of applications in Kubernetes, and they serve as the encapsulation for the container(s) and their shared resources. Containers within a Pod run on the same underlying node and can communicate with each other using `localhost`.

Here are some key characteristics of Pods:

1. **Co-Located Containers:** All containers within a Pod run on the same node and share the same network namespace. This allows them to communicate via `localhost`, making inter-container communication more efficient.

2. **Shared Storage and Volumes:** Containers within a Pod can share the same storage volumes. This enables them to share data or access configuration files that are mounted as volumes within the Pod.

3. **Single IP Address:** Each Pod is assigned a unique IP address within the cluster. Containers within the Pod share this IP address.

4. **Lifetime and Scaling:** Pods are considered relatively ephemeral. They are not designed to be long-lived. Instead, they can be easily created, updated, or deleted as needed. Scaling is achieved by creating multiple replicas of a Pod.

5. **Atomic Unit for Deployment:** When you want to deploy multiple containers together, such as an application and a sidecar container, you typically create them as part of the same Pod.

`While Pods offer a convenient way to manage related containers as a single unit, they are not meant to be used as long-term entities. Instead, they are designed to be created, scaled, and destroyed frequently. This design philosophy aligns with Kubernetes' approach to manage applications in a declarative manner, where you specify the desired state of your application, and Kubernetes handles the actual state and takes the necessary actions to achieve the desired state.`

### 4. **Deployments:**

<img src="https://bit.ly/3OqC48q" alt="k8s deployments" width="800px" height ="500px" margin-left="14px">

Image Source: [Kubernetes Deployments](https://thenewstack.io/kubernetes-deployments-work/)

So, why it is not the recommended way to create pods first?`The answer is that pods are not self-healing. If a pod fails, it will not be recreated automatically. This is where Deployments come in handy as they provide a declarative way to manage pods and ensure that the desired state is always maintained.`

In Kubernetes, a Deployment is a higher-level abstraction that facilitates the management of replica sets and rolling updates.
Deployments defines the desired state of an application. It provides declarative updates for Pods and ReplicaSets, ensuring that the desired number of replicas is maintained. Deployments enable easy scaling and rolling updates, making them a crucial component of Kubernetes.

1. **Declarative Updates:** Deployments allow you to declaratively define the desired state of your application. Kubernetes handles the actual state and takes the necessary actions to achieve the desired state.

2. **Rolling Updates:** Deployments support rolling updates, allowing you to update your application to a new version without downtime. Kubernetes gradually updates the application by creating new replicas with the updated version while scaling down the old replicas.

3. **Rollbacks:** Deployments also support rollbacks, allowing you to quickly revert to a previous version of your application if any issues arise during the update process.

4. **Scaling:** Deployments make it easy to scale your application by creating multiple replicas of the same Pod. You can scale up or down the number of replicas based on demand without affecting other services running on the same cluster.

5. **Self-Healing:** Deployments ensure that the desired number of replicas is always maintained. If a Pod or node fails, Kubernetes automatically restarts or reschedules the affected containers to maintain application availability.

6. **Pod Template:** Deployments use a Pod template to create new Pods. The template defines the desired state of the Pod, including the container image, resource requests/limits, environment variables, and more.

7. **ReplicaSets:** Deployments use ReplicaSets to manage the lifecycle of Pods. ReplicaSets are the next level of abstraction above Pods. They ensure that a specified number of pod replicas are running at any given time. If a pod fails or becomes unresponsive, the ReplicaSet replaces it with a new pod to maintain the desired state.
8. **Pod Lifecycle:** Deployments manage the lifecycle of Pods. They create new Pods when scaling up or updating the application and delete old Pods when scaling down or rolling back to a previous version.

9. **Pod Scheduling:** Deployments use the scheduler to assign Pods to nodes based on resource availability and constraints. They also support affinity/anti-affinity rules to control the placement of Pods on nodes.

### 5. **Services:**

Services provide a stable network endpoint and load balancing for a set of Pods. They enable seamless communication between different components of an application.

### 6. **Ingress:**

Ingress manages external access to services within the cluster. It acts as a gateway, routing incoming traffic to the appropriate services based on user-defined rules.

### 7. **ConfigMaps and Secrets:**

ConfigMaps store configuration data, and Secrets securely store sensitive information, such as passwords or API keys. Both ConfigMaps and Secrets can be accessed by applications running in Pods.

## Some Detail Explanation of major components

### **Kubelet**

Kubelet is a fundamental component of the Kubernetes system, and it runs on each node (worker node) in the cluster. It plays a critical role in managing containers and ensuring that the containers defined in pod specifications are running and healthy.

Here's a detailed explanation of Kubelet and its responsibilities:

**Kubelet Responsibilities:**

1. **Pod Lifecycle Management:** Kubelet is responsible for managing the lifecycle of pods on a node. It communicates with the Kubernetes control plane to receive pod specifications and ensure that the pods are running and healthy. It starts, stops, and restarts containers based on the desired state specified by the control plane.

2. **Container Operations:** Kubelet interacts directly with the container runtime (e.g., Docker, containerd) to manage containers on the node. It starts and stops containers, monitors their health, and reports the container's status back to the control plane.

3. **Volume Management:** Kubelet mounts volumes specified in pod definitions and ensures that the appropriate storage is available to containers within the pod.

4. **Pod Networking:** Kubelet sets up the network namespace for each pod and ensures that containers within the pod can communicate with each other and other pods in the cluster. It works closely with the CNI (Container Network Interface) plugins to achieve this.

5. **Resource Management:** Kubelet monitors the node's resource usage (CPU, memory, disk, etc.) and reports this information back to the control plane. It ensures that resource requests and limits specified in pod definitions are enforced.

6. **Health Monitoring:** Kubelet continuously monitors the health of the containers it manages. If a container fails or becomes unresponsive, Kubelet takes appropriate actions based on the pod's restart policy.

7. **Container Image Management:** Kubelet pulls container images from container registries (e.g., Docker Hub) when required. It also periodically checks for image updates and ensures that the right versions of images are used.

8. **Node Status Reporting:** Kubelet is responsible for reporting the node's status, including its capacity, utilization, and conditions, to the control plane. This information is crucial for the scheduler to make informed decisions about pod placement.

9. **Pod Security Policies:** Kubelet enforces any pod security policies set by the cluster administrator to ensure that pods meet certain security requirements.

**How Kubelet Works:**

1. **API Server Interaction:** Kubelet interacts with the Kubernetes API server to receive instructions for pod creation, updates, and deletions. It also reports the status of the node and its managed pods back to the API server.

2. **Pod Watches:** Kubelet watches the API server for changes to pod specifications and reacts to updates or changes in the desired state of pods. If there are discrepancies between the actual state of a pod and the desired state, Kubelet takes appropriate actions to reconcile the differences.

3. **Node Registration:** When a node joins the cluster, Kubelet registers the node with the Kubernetes control plane, providing information about its resources and capabilities.

4. **Managing Pod Manifests:** Kubelet reads and interprets the pod manifests (definitions) provided by the control plane to determine which containers should be running on the node.

In summary, Kubelet is an essential agent running on each node in the Kubernetes cluster. It ensures that the containers defined in pod specifications are up and running, handles their lifecycle, and communicates with the control plane to maintain the desired state of the cluster. Without Kubelet, the Kubernetes cluster would not be able to manage and orchestrate containers effectively.

| Containers  | Containers are lightweight, standalone executable software packages that encapsulate application components and dependencies. They provide a consistent and isolated environment for running applications. The key benefits of using containers include portability, scalability, and resource efficiency. Containers utilize containerization technologies like Docker, allowing developers to package applications and all their dependencies into a single unit, making it easier to deploy and manage across different environments. Kubernetes leverages containers to manage and orchestrate application workloads efficiently.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Pods        | Pods are the fundamental building blocks in Kubernetes. A pod represents the smallest deployable unit and acts as a logical host for one or more closely related containers. Containers within a pod share the same network namespace, enabling them to communicate with each other using localhost. Pods are designed to be ephemeral and can be created, deleted, or replicated dynamically based on workload requirements. Kubernetes uses pods to distribute and balance the containers across nodes in the cluster. They provide a convenient way to group containers that work together as a single application, such as a web server and a database. Using pods ensures that these containers are scheduled and managed together on the same node.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Deployments | Deployments are a higher-level abstraction in Kubernetes that facilitate the management of replica sets and rolling updates. A deployment defines the desired state of the application and automatically handles the process of creating and scaling replicas (pods) to maintain that state. Deployments ensure high availability and fault tolerance by continuously monitoring and adjusting the number of replicas based on the specified configuration. One of the significant advantages of using deployments is the ability to perform rolling updates. Kubernetes can gradually update the application to a new version without causing downtime. It achieves this by creating new pods with the updated version while scaling down the old pods. If any issues arise during the update, the deployment can quickly roll back to the previous version, ensuring the application's stability and reliability. Deployments simplify the management of applications, making it easier to deploy, upgrade, and maintain the desired state of the application. |
